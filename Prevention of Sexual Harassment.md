# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) - Reflection

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can happen when someone crosses personal boundaries in a way that makes others feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or disrespected. Examples include:

- Making personal comments about someone’s appearance in a sexual way
- Trying to invade someone’s personal space without their permission
- Sending repeated messages or emails with inappropriate content
- Making someone feel threatened or embarrassed through tone or jokes
- Blocking someone's path or standing too close in an intimidating way
- Sharing or forwarding rumors about someone’s private life

Such behaviour can happen at the workplace, during work calls, messages, or even outside work if it affects the professional environment.

## 2. What would you do if you face or witness such behaviour?

If I ever face or witness sexual harassment, I would take the following steps:

- Make sure the affected person feels supported and not alone
- Avoid blaming the victim or treating it like a casual matter
- Report the issue to the Internal Committee (IC) or company’s PoSH officer
- Keep a written note of what happened, in case it’s needed later
- Follow up to ensure the complaint is taken seriously and handled confidentially
- Speak up respectfully if I see something wrong happening, only if it’s safe

It’s important to act early and not ignore it. Everyone deserves a safe and respectful work environment.
