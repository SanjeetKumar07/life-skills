## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Most interesting story or idea:**  
The most interesting idea was how BJ Fogg suggests starting with very small habits like doing two pushups or flossing one tooth. It showed me that even small actions can lead to big changes over time if done regularly. It makes habits feel easy to start.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

**B = MAP Explanation:**  
B stands for Behavior, and it happens when M (Motivation), A (Ability), and P (Prompt) come together. To build a habit, I can focus on making it easier to do and link it to something I already do so I don’t need a lot of motivation.

**Importance of Celebrating:**  
Celebrating helps me feel good after doing the habit. That feeling makes me want to do it again. BJ Fogg says that what we celebrate becomes a habit, and I think that’s true because it builds a positive connection with the action.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video

**Most interesting story or idea:**  
The idea that getting just 1% better every day adds up over time was very interesting. The story about how the British cycling team made small improvements and became successful was really inspiring. It showed that small efforts matter.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

**Book’s perspective about Identity:**  
The book says that our habits should match who we want to be. For example, instead of saying I want to read more, I should say I am a reader. When I think like that, it’s easier to keep the habit.

**Making a habit easier to do:**  
To make a habit easier, I can remove things that make it hard. The two-minute rule is helpful, like starting by reading one page or doing one pushup. It makes it simple to begin.

**Making a habit harder to do:**  
To stop a bad habit, I can make it harder to do. Like uninstalling social media apps or keeping snacks far away. When it’s not easy to do, I won’t do it often.

## 5. Reflection

**Habit to do more of:**  
I want to read books every day. I will:
- Keep a book near me after breakfast
- Read one page in the morning
- Use a tracker app to mark my progress

**Habit to eliminate:**  
I want to stop checking my phone first thing in the morning. I will:
- Keep my phone in another room at night
- Use a real alarm clock instead
- Notice how much better I feel when I don’t use my phone early
