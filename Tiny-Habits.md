# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg  
**Most interesting story or idea:**  
In the video, the part that I liked most was how BJ Fogg said we can build habits by starting very small, like doing just one push-up or flossing one tooth. This helped me understand that starting with something tiny can make a big difference later.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message  
**B = MAP Explanation:**  
B stands for Behavior. The formula is B = MAP, which means:  
- M is Motivation (how much I want to do it)  
- A is Ability (how easy it is to do)  
- P is Prompt (what reminds me to do it)  
If all three are there, I can build a habit easily. Making the habit simple and using a reminder helps it stick.

**Importance of Celebrating:**  
Celebrating after doing a habit helps my brain feel good about it. This feeling makes me want to do it again. It can be as simple as saying "yes!" or smiling after completing the habit. That way, the habit becomes more natural.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video  
**Most interesting story or idea:**  
I liked the idea that if I get just 1% better every day, I can make big changes over time. The video shared the story of the British cycling team, who made small changes in many areas and saw great results. This showed me that small efforts every day matter a lot.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits  
**Book’s perspective about Identity:**  
The book says it’s easier to stick with a habit when it becomes part of who I am. For example, instead of saying “I want to read,” I can say “I am a reader.” Thinking this way helps build habits that last.

**Making a habit easier to do:**  
To make a habit easy, I should remove any extra steps. Like if I want to study, I can keep my notes and laptop ready. I should also start small, like studying for just two minutes.

**Making a habit harder to do:**  
To stop a bad habit, I should make it more difficult. For example, to use my phone less, I can log out of apps or keep the phone away. The harder it is to do, the less likely I’ll keep doing it.

## 5. Reflection  
**Habit to do more of:**  
I want to go for a short walk every day.  
Steps I will take:  
- Go for a walk right after lunch  
- Use a step counter app to track my progress  

**Habit to eliminate:**  
I want to stop watching too many videos online.  
Steps I will take:  
- Log out of YouTube and other apps  
- Set a timer or app limit
- I will try not to renew my Netflix subscription.
- Remind myself how good I feel when I spend time doing something useful
