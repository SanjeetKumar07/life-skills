# **Good Practices for Software Development**
### **Question 1**  
**Which point(s) were new to you?**

- The emphasis on "over-communication" was new to me. I used to think that frequent updates might be annoying, but I now understand that sharing progress, blockers, or delays openly (especially in public channels) builds trust and helps the team move forward smoothly.  
- Using screencasts (like Loom) and visual aids while asking technical questions is a new and valuable idea that I hadnâ€™t used before.
- Join the meetings 5-10 mins early to get some time with your team members

### **Question 2**  
**Which area do you think you need to improve on?**  
**What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

- **Area to Improve:** Deep work and focused productivity.  
- **Ideas to Improve:**
  - Set daily time blocks with no distractions (phone on silent, no social media).
  - Use tools like Pomodoro timers or the Boosted app to track time.
  - Review my productivity at the end of each day to see what helped me stay focused.
  - Maintain a to-do list and prioritize 2-3 high-impact tasks daily.
